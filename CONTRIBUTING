Thanks for your interest in the Source Engine Storybook project.  When you make a
contribution to the project (e.g. create an Issue or submit a Pull Request)
(a "Contribution"), the project owner wants to be able to use your Contribution to improve
the project.

As a condition of providing a Contribution, you agree that: 
- You grant the project owner a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide license
to make, use, sell, reproduce, modify, distribute (directly and indirectly),
and publicly display and perform the Contribution, and any derivative works
that the project owner may make from the Contribution, under any intellectual property you
own or have the right to license. 
- You warrant and represent that the Contribution is your original creation,
that you have the authority to grant this license to the project owner, and that this
license does not require the permission of any third party.  Otherwise, you
provide your Contribution "as is" without warranties.  

Should you wish to submit a suggestion or work that is not your original
creation, you may submit it to the project owner separate from any Contribution,
explicitly identifying it as sourced from a third party, stating the details
of its origin, and informing the project owner of any license or other restriction of
which you are personally aware. 

This is done so that if we wish to distribute via Steam in the future the project owner does not need to hunt down all contributors to ask for permission.

All contributors will be listed in the CONTRIBUTORS file and shall be included with all distributions.
